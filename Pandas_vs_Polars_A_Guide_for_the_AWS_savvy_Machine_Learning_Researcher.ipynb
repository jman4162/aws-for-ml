        "# Pandas vs. Polars: A Guide for the AWS-savvy Machine Learning Researcher\n",

        "As a machine learning researcher working with massive datasets on AWS, you're likely familiar with the limitations of Pandas when it comes to performance. Polars, a blazingly fast DataFrame library built in Rust with Python bindings, offers a compelling alternative. This guide highlights the key differences between Pandas and Polars, focusing on aspects relevant to your AWS workflow using S3, Athena, and Sagemaker.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Core Differences & Advantages of Polars:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Lazy Evaluation:** Polars employs lazy evaluation, meaning it builds an execution plan first and only processes data when needed. This optimizes operations and significantly reduces memory usage for large datasets. Pandas, on the other hand, evaluates operations eagerly.\n",
        "* **Parallel Processing:** Polars leverages multiple CPU cores by default for various operations, leading to faster data manipulation and analysis. Pandas primarily relies on single-core processing, though some operations offer limited parallelization.\n",
        "* **Memory Efficiency:** Polars uses Apache Arrow as its memory model, resulting in highly efficient data storage and faster data access. Pandas relies on its own internal data structures, which can be less memory-efficient, especially for mixed data types.\n",
        "* **Query Optimization:** Polars' lazy evaluation allows for sophisticated query optimization, automatically rearranging operations for maximum efficiency. Pandas lacks this advanced optimization capability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Transitioning from Pandas to Polars:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1 Data Loading:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pandas:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import pandas as pd\n",
        "\n",
        "# From S3 using boto3\n",
        "import boto3\n",
        "s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n",
        "obj = s3.get_object(Bucket='your-bucket', Key='your-data.csv')\n",
        "df = pd.read_csv(obj['Body'])\n",
        "\n",
        "# From Parquet\n",
        "df = pd.read_parquet('your-data.parquet')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Polars:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import polars as pl\n",
        "\n",
        "# From S3 using fsspec\n",
        "import fsspec\n",
        "fs = fsspec.filesystem('s3', profile='your-aws-profile')\n",
        "df = pl.read_csv(fs.open('s3://your-bucket/your-data.csv'))\n",
        "\n",
        "# From Parquet\n",
        "df = pl.read_parquet('your-data.parquet')\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Polars seamlessly integrates with `fsspec` for accessing various cloud storage, including S3.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Data Manipulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pandas:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Filtering\n",
        "df_filtered = df[df['column_name'] > 10]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Selecting columns\n",
        "df_selected = df[['column_1', 'column_2']]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Grouping and aggregation\n",

        "# Grouping and aggregation\n",
        "df_grouped = df.group_by('column_name').agg(pl.col('other_column').sum())\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** Polars uses an expression syntax for data manipulation that is more concise and readable compared to Pandas' chained operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.3 Data Exploration:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pandas:**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## 3. Utilizing Polars with AWS Tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **S3 Integration:** Polars' `fsspec` integration facilitates seamless data loading and saving from S3 buckets.\n",
        "* **Athena Integration:** You can query data stored in S3 via Athena using PyAthena and convert the results to a Polars DataFrame for efficient analysis.\n",
        "* **Sagemaker Integration:** Utilize Polars within your Sagemaker notebooks or training scripts to process and analyze data faster, reducing training time and improving model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Example Workflow: Preprocessing data on S3 for Sagemaker with Polars\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import polars as pl\n",
        "import fsspec\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. Load data from S3\n",
        "fs = fsspec.filesystem('s3', profile='your-aws-profile')\n",
        "df = pl.read_parquet(fs.open('s3://your-bucket/your-data.parquet'))\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Data preprocessing with Polars\n",
        "#   - Filter irrelevant data\n",
        "df = df.filter(pl.col('column_name') > 10)\n",
        "#   - Feature engineering\n",
        "df = df.with_columns(\n",
        "    (pl.col('column_1') * pl.col('column_2')).alias('new_feature')\n",
        ")\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Save preprocessed data back to S3\n",
        "df.write_parquet(fs.open('s3://your-bucket/preprocessed-data.parquet', 'wb'))\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This example demonstrates how you can efficiently load, preprocess, and save data on S3 using Polars, preparing it for training within your Sagemaker environment.\n",
