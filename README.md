# AWS for ML

This repository contains examples and tutorials for utilizing various AWS services in machine learning (ML) workflows. These examples are designed to help data scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers integrate AWS tools into their ML pipelines, from data processing and model training to deployment and automation.

## Overview

Machine learning often requires dealing with large datasets and scalable infrastructure. AWS offers a wide range of services tailored to meet these needs, from data storage and processing to model deployment and management. This repository aims to provide hands-on tutorials and code examples for efficiently using AWS services in different stages of the ML lifecycle.

## Tutorials

1. **[Advanced Python Tutorial on AWS Athena for Machine Learning Scientists](https://github.com/jman4162/aws-for-ml/blob/main/Advanced_Python_Tutorial_on_AWS_Athena_for_Machine_Learning_Scientists.ipynb)**
   - Learn how to leverage AWS Athena for querying large datasets stored in Amazon S3. This tutorial demonstrates how to use Python, Boto3, and PandasCursor to preprocess and analyze data, making it easily accessible for machine learning tasks.

2. *Upcoming Tutorials:*
   - **AWS Lambda for Automating ML Pipelines**: Learn how to use AWS Lambda to automate data ingestion, preprocessing, and model deployment.
   - **Amazon SageMaker for End-to-End ML**: Explore how to build, train, and deploy machine learning models with Amazon SageMaker.
   - **Using AWS Glue for ETL in ML Workflows**: Understand how to use AWS Glue for extracting, transforming, and loading large datasets into a machine learning pipeline.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository and follow the individual tutorial guides. Each tutorial is contained within its own directory and provides step-by-step instructions along with code examples.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jman4162/aws-for-ml.git
cd aws-for-ml
```

Make sure to install the required dependencies for each tutorial. For example, for the Athena tutorial:

```bash
pip install -r athena-tutorial/requirements.txt
```

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorials, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account**: Access to AWS services like Athena, Lambda, SageMaker, and S3.
- **AWS CLI**: Configured with your credentials.
- **Python Environment**: Python 3.7 or later installed.
